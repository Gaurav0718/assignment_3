Task 1
# Factorial Calculator in Python

This Python program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter an integer
- Defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial
- Returns `1` for input less than 2 (base case)
- Calculates factorial recursively for numbers 2 and above
- Prints the final result in a formatted output

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment. Enter a non-negative integer when prompted, and the program will display its factorial.

Task 2

# Math Functions in Python

This Python program demonstrates the use of the built-in `math` module to perform mathematical operations on a user-provided number.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter a number
- Calculates:
  - Square root (`math.sqrt`)
  - Natural logarithm (`math.log`)
  - Sine of the number in radians (`math.sin`)
- Displays the results in a formatted output

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment. Enter a positive number when prompted, and the program will display the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of that number.
